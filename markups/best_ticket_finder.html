        <p>By selecting this option, ScratchShark will identify the ticket that gives you the best odds of winning
            something. It won't necessarily recommend the ticket with the best odds of winning a jackpot, but it will
            maximize the odds of scratching a winner.</p>

            <h2>Has the best value:</h2>
        </div>
        <p>By selecting this option, ScratchShark will identify the ticket that gives you the highest expected value.
            That is to say, the ticket with the largest amount of unclaimed prize money relative to the number of
            tickets remaining. In other words, this option will recommend the ticket that gives you the most bang for
            your buck!</p>
